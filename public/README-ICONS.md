# PWA Icons Required

Please add the following icon files to the `/public` directory:

- `icon-192x192.png` - App icon at 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512x512.png` - App icon at 512x512 pixels

These icons should:
- Use the IronPlate AI branding
- Have a transparent or theme-colored background (#0f172a)
- Be optimized for display on mobile home screens
- Support maskable icon requirements (safe zone for icon content)

## Temporary Placeholder

For development, you can use any 192x192 and 512x512 PNG files as placeholders.
The PWA will still function without these, but will show default browser icons.
